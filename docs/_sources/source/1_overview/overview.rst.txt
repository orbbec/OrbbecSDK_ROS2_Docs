OrbbecSDK_ROS2 is a wrapper for the Orbbec 3D camera that provides seamless integration with the ROS2 environment. It
supports ROS2 Foxy, Humble, Iron, and Jazzy distributions.

With the major update of the new branch v2-main in October 2024, OrbbecSDK_ROS2 is connected to the open source version of OrbbecSDK v2,
which will make OrbbecSDK_ROS2 more flexible and extensible. This update in v2-main ensures compatibility with all new Orbbec USB products
that comply with the UVC standard. However, OrbbecSDK_ROS2 v2 no longer supports Orbbec's traditional OpenNI protocol devices.
We encourage you to check whether your device is supported by OrbbecSDK_ROS2 v2 and use the new version if supported.
