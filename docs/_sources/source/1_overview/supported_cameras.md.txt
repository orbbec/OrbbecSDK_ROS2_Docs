# Supported cameras

> **Important**

> Welcome to the OrbbecSDK ROS2 Wrapper. Before you begin using this version of ROS2 wrapper, it's crucial to check the following device support list to verify the compatibility.


OrbbecSDK ROS2 Wrapper provides seamless integration of Orbbec cameras with ROS 2 environment. It supports ROS2 Foxy, Humble, and Jazzy distributions.

With a major update in October 2024, we release the [OrbbecSDK ROS2 Wrapper v2](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_ROS2/tree/v2-main) connected to the open source [OrbbecSDK v2](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_v2/releases) with enhanced flexibility and extensibility. This update ensures compatibility with all Orbbec USB products adhering to UVC standard. However, it no longer supports Orbbec's traditional OpenNI protocol devices. We strongly encourage you to use the v2-main branch if your device is supported.

Here is the device support list of main branch (v1.x) and v2-main branch (v2.x):
